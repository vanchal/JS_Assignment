Ques:
18.What will be the output for the following:
var a = () => {
console.log("a called");
};
a();
var a = 34;
a();


Output:

a called
TypeError: a is not a function


Here first function expression is written and stored in variable a , which is invoked and prints the desired output .
Again a is redefined a value therefore variable is overwritten with a value therefore it is no longer a function, 
and hence displays type error on invoking again .
