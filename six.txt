Ques:
6. What will be the output of the following code?
var a = {a: 1};
var b = {a: 1};
console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
var c = a;
console.log(a == c);
console.log(a === c);


Output:

false              // objects are compared using their reference hence a and b have different reference in memory so false
false              // objects are compared using their reference hence a and b have different reference in memory so false
true               // object a is assigned to c therefore a and c point to same address in memory and therefore equals true
true               // object a is assigned to c therefore a and c point to same address in memory and therefore equals true
