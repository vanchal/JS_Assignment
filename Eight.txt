Ques:
8. What will be the output of the following code?
let a;
console.log(a === undefined);
console.log(a === null);
console.log(a*2);
console.log(`${a} is the value of a`);


Output:

true     // a value has not be defined only memory is alloted therefore it is undefined and on strict equality returns true
false    // a value is undefined and not null therefore on strict equality check  gibves a false
NaN      // since a is not assigned any value it is undefined and multiplication operation is applied on numbers therfore its gives NaN
"undefined is the value of a"  // since a is not initialised it is undefined therefore it gives undefined as value.
