Ques:
15.What is the output of the following code?
function f1(object) {
const obj = { name: "Daniel", age: 27 };
if (object.age === 20) {
const obj = { name: "Jack" };
object.name = "Sam";
console.log(obj.age);
} else {
const obj = { name: "Emily" };
object = null;
console.log(obj.name);
}
}
const ob1 = { name: "Mark", age: 20 };
const ob2 = { name: "Karl", age: 21 };
f1(ob1);
console.log(ob1);
f1(ob2);
console.log(ob2);


Output:

undefined                  // Since const is block scope , obj inside block does not contain age key so undefined
{ name: 'Sam', age: 20 }   // Since ob1 and copy of ob1 in object point to same reference therefore change in object name reflects in ob1 
Emily                       // inside block object (obj) has key(name) whose value is Emily
{ name: 'Karl', age: 21 }   // object is pointed to different reference but ob2 does not therefore chnage in object does not reflect in ob2
